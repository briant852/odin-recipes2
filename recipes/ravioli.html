    <p>Ravioli are a type of pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin pasta dough. 
        Usually served in broth or with a sauce, they originated as a traditional food in Italian cuisine. 
        Ravioli are commonly square, though other forms are also used, including circular and semi-circular.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Crack eggs into the center. 
            Beat eggs with a fork until blended. Use the fork to gradually draw in flour from the sides, 
            mixing until all the flour is incorporated.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, 
            3 to 4 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses together in a bowl. Whisk water and egg together in a small bowl to make egg wash.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour the work surface again. Roll out dough into a thin sheet. Cut into hearts using a cookie cutter. Brush edges with egg wash. Spoon filling into the center of 1/2 of the hearts; cover with remaining hearts. Press edges together to seal.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli in batches and wait until they float to the top. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes after that. Transfer to a colander using a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining ravioli.</li>
    </ol>
