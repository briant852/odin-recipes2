    <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the beef in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir the soup in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the soup is reduced, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Divide the beef mixture among the taco shells. Top with the lettuce, tomato and cheese.</li>
    </ol>
